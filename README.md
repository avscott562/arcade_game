## Instructions

#### How to Run the Game
The game can be found at https://github.com/avscott562/arcade_game.  Load the game by opening the *index.html* file.  The game board, enemies(bugs), and player are created opening the file.  A modal pops up to allow user to select a character to use as the player.  Once a character is selected, the modal will close.

The player is positioned in the starting position at the bottom center of the board (grass area).  The player uses the left, right, up, and down arrow keys to determine how the player will move.  If a player collides with an enemy, the player will be returned to the starting position.

Once the player makes it to the water without colliding with an enemy, a modal will pop up notifying the player that they have won.  The player will be prompted with the option to play again or to quit the game.

#### Play the Game
The game can be found at https://github.com/avscott562/arcade_game.  Load the game by opening the *index.html* file.  There are 5 characters that can be used as the player.  After loading the game, choose which character you want to use as your player for the game by clicking on the character's picture.

You will start off in the grassy area at the bottom center of the game board.  Your objective is to reach the water at the top of the game board without colliding with any of the enemies (bugs).  To move the player, use the left, right, up and down arrow keys.  If you collide with a bug, you will be automatically returned to the starting position.

If you make it to the water without any collisions with bugs, you win!  You can try your luck again or stop playing.
