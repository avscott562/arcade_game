## Instructions

#### How to Run the Game
Load the game from the git repository.  Game board, enemies(bugs), and player are created.  Modal pops up to allow user to select a character to use as the player.  Once a character is selected, modal will close.

Player uses arrows to determine how the player is moved.  If a player collides with an enemy, the player will be returned to the starting position.

Once the player makes it to the water without colliding with an enemy, a modal will pop up notifying the player that they have won.  The player will be prompted with the option to play again or to quit the game.

#### Play the Game
Choose one character from 5 options to use as your player for the game.  Use the left, right, up and down arrow keys to move the player across the board.  The objective is for your player to make it from the grass to the water without colliding with any bugs.  If you collide with a bug, you will be automatically returned to the starting position.

If you make it to the water without any collisions with bugs, you win!  You can try your luck again or stop playing.
